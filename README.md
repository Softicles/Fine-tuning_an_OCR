# Fine-tune PaddleOCR to Suit My Handwriting

This project was developed as part of **CS3600 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence** taught by **Professor Alexander Karpekov** during **Summer 2025** at **Georgia Tech**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to **fine-tune PaddleOCRâ€™s recognition model** to better recognize and transcribe my personal handwriting. While PaddleOCR provides powerful general-purpose text detection and recognition tools, its accuracy drops significantly when used with my handwriting, even though I think my hand writing is not that bad. Therefore, I want to train it using my handwriting so that it can recognize my handwriting with high accuracy.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- **PaddleOCR**: Open-source OCR system developed by PaddlePaddle
- **PPOCRLabel**: GUI tool for labeling OCR datasets ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/PFCCLab/PPOCRLabel))
- **Python**
- **PaddlePaddle deep learning framework**

## ðŸ“‚ Data Preparation

The labeled dataset was created using **PPOCRLabel**, which supports text detection and recognition annotations tailored for PaddleOCR training.

Steps:
1. Converted my handwriting pdfs to JPEG
2. Annotated bounding boxes and corresponding transcriptions in PPOCRLabel.
3. Exported in the format required for PaddleOCR training (`.txt` and image files in `output_images`/`crop_img` structure).
