# Fine-tune PaddleOCR to Suit My Handwriting

This project was developed as part of **CS3600 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence** taught by **Professor Alexander Karpekov** during **Summer 2025** at **Georgia Tech**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to **fine-tune PaddleOCRâ€™s recognition model** to better recognize and transcribe my personal handwriting. While PaddleOCR provides powerful general-purpose text detection and recognition tools, its accuracy may drop significantly when used with highly stylized or non-standard handwriting. This project adapts the model to overcome that limitation by training it on custom-labeled samples of my own handwriting.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- **PaddleOCR**: Open-source OCR system developed by PaddlePaddle
- **PPOCRLabel**: GUI tool for labeling OCR datasets ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/PFCCLab/PPOCRLabel))
- **Python**
- **PaddlePaddle deep learning framework**

## ðŸ“‚ Data Preparation

The labeled dataset was created using **PPOCRLabel**, which supports text detection and recognition annotations tailored for PaddleOCR training.

Steps:
1. Collected scanned or photographed handwritten text samples.
2. Annotated bounding boxes and corresponding transcriptions in PPOCRLabel.
3. Exported in the format required for PaddleOCR training (`.txt` and image files in `train`/`val` structure).

## ðŸ§  Fine-Tuning Process

- Used the CRNN-based recognition model (`rec_mv3_none_bilstm_ctc`) as a base.
- Followed PaddleOCRâ€™s training pipeline and configuration.
- Adjusted training parameters for character dictionary, learning rate, and number of epochs to optimize for the limited dataset.

## ðŸ“ˆ Outcomes

- Achieved improved accuracy on handwritten samples compared to the default model.
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of transfer learning and data annotation in OCR adaptation tasks.
